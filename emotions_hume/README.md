# CalHacks AI Hackathon Resources

## Hume
Hume provides the AI toolkit to measure, understand, and improve how technology affects human emotion. Our algorithms understand nuanced speech prosody, vocal bursts, facial expression, and tone of language—which, integrated into large language models, will determine how people experience the future of AI. Our APIs can process video, audio, images, or text and can be integrated with LLMs to build better healthcare solutions, digital assistants, communication tools, and more.

## Samples
The projects in this repo are for you to use as samples to build your project.

### [Sandbox](https://github.com/HumeAI/CalHacks/tree/main/sandbox)
**NodeJS** 

Provides a sample on how to use Hume AI [Streaming API](https://docs.hume.ai/doc/streaming-api) with your webcam and mic.
### [Humechat](https://github.com/HumeAI/CalHacks/tree/main/humechat)
**Python**

Provides a sample on how to use OpenAPI with Hume AI.
It will provide a sample on how to stringify Hume API expression predictions with OpenAPI.

### [Expressions2Text](https://github.com/HumeAI/CalHacks/tree/main/expression2textembeddings)
**Python**

Expressions2Text tool takes a (48,1) array of emotion scores and transforms it into human understandable text, which can then be further transformed into a language embedding.
